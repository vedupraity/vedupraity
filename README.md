### Hi there 👋

My name is **Vedprakash Upraity**, I'm a **Software Engineer** / **Devops Engineer** at [Tweeny Technologies](https://www.tweeny.in/).

And, here's my side project: [Ancient Knowledge](https://www.ancientknowledge.in/), which is a free and open-source library of Texts, Scriptures and Books to learn the foundation of Sanātana Dharma.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I compose Electronic Dance Music and Cinematic Scores.
